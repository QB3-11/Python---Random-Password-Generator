# Python---Random-Password-Generator
A random password generator which generates a random password of 8 digits using python
I am making this project as an intermediate. There may be things that can be done better than I did it in the code. Apart from that, I hope that this helps someone.
I am using a list to generate a random sign because the ASCII decimal numbers of these signs are not in a continous ascending order.
That's all the explanation.

HOW TO USE?!
Just hit enter and a random 8 digit password will be generated
